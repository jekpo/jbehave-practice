All story java classes are declared in the package org.aicer.jbehave.automation.story

All steps java classes are declared in the package org.aicer.jbehave.automation.steps

The story text files must match the Java story names

The only difference is that the Java class is camel case whereas the text files are all lowercase with underscores to separate the words.

For example CustomerStory.java is mapped to customer_story.story
